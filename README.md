## Identifying Key Drivers of Customer Satisfaction using Logistics Regression
Traditionally, many would perform descriptive analytics on customer satisfaction data. While this is important, it doesn't answer two key business questions - (1) what drives customer satisfaction in my organisation and (2) what are my next course of actions.

Both of these questions can be addressed with a machine learning algorithm. I have illustrated it in this repo using logistics regression. However, any classification models such as Naive Bayes, Random Forest, XGBoost, etc. work as well.
