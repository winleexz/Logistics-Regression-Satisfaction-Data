# Identifying Key Drivers of Customer Satisfaction using Logistics Regression
This repo provides one of my earliest encounters with Machine Learning. Traditionally, many would perform descriptive analytics on customer satisfaction data. While this is important, it doesn't answer two key business questions - (1) what drives customer satisfaction in my organisation and (2) what are my next course of actions.

Both of these questions can be addressed with a machine learning algorithm. I have illustrated it using logistics regression. However, any classification models such as Random Forest, XGBoost, etc. can be used.
